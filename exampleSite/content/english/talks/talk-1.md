**TED'INNOV** is a series of webinars organized internally at [SONATEL](https://sonatel.sn/ "SONATEL"), the National Senegalese Telecom Operator, with the aim of promoting innovation and the use of emerging technologies.

It is in this perspective that I animated a conference on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in the world of Telecoms** covering:

* An overview of Artificial Intelligence ;
* Its genesis and functioning ;
* Various applications relevant to Telcos ;
* The pyramid of needs to get into AI.

This was followed by a rich Q&A session with the audience before the session was closed. Perspectives of collaboration with [GalsenAI](http://galsen.ai/ "GalsenAI"), **the first AI community in Senegal**, were raised in order to support this company in its transition to data.
