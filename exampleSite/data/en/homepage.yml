  content: "I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at [**ESP**](https://esp.sn/) of [**Cheikh
    Anta Diop University of Dakar**](https://www.ucad.sn/) under the supervision of
    [**Mr. Diallo**](http://edmi.ucad.sn/~moussadiallo/). I am a recipient of the
    [**Google Ph.D. Fellowship 2021**](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/)
    in the **Natural Language Processing** section and I am currently working with
    my mentor **Clara Rivera**, Program Manager at Google.\n\nMy research work revolves
    around Task-oriented Dialogue Systems for Low-Resource Languages. I target [**Wolof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolof_language)
    as a case study but I am more generally interested in African Languages, hence
    my integration in [**Masakhane**](https://www.masakhane.io/). I am a co-founder
    of the [**GalsenAI**](https://galsen.ai/) community and I like to meet new people,
    share, and discover new experiences.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to
    contact me on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/derguene) \U0001F609"
